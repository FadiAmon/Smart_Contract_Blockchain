# Smart_Contract_Blockchain


The goal of this project is to empower users to securely store sensitive data and information in the blockchain, ensuring it remains immutable and free from third-party interference like governments or lawyers. A user-friendly GUI developed with Flask facilitates easy interaction with the smart contract, enabling users to upload and transfer apartments seamlessly

Full functionality of the smart contract:

-  uploadApartment

-  transferApartment

-  getApartmentDetails

-  getTransferHistory

-  deleteApartment
