# Smart_Contract_Blockchain

This project aims to able users to store sensetive data and information in the blockchain where it has no risk of getting changed or deleted,
hence there no need for a third party inteference such as governments or lawyers.

I created a simple GUI using flask that ables the users to interacte with the smart contract, so they could upload their apartment, or transfer it.

Full functionality of the smart contract:

-  uploadApartment

-  transferApartment

-  getApartmentDetails

-  getTransferHistory

-  deleteApartment
